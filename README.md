# Automations Library

## Overview
The Automations library is a robust framework designed for smart contracts written in Move on Sui. It facilitates the creation and management of automated operations using objects, which can be triggered manually or via backend processes. This library is particularly useful for decentralized autonomous organizations, multisig wallets, and other on-chain entities requiring automated workflows.

## Features
- **Transfer To Object-based Automations**: Automations are centered around the concept of delegating operations with assets to intents which are executed by an automation object handling their lifecycle.
- **Flexible Triggering**: Operations can be initiated by any signer, including a backend, providing flexibility in managing automated processes.
- **Modular Design**: Designed for on-chain Entities. Ideal for DAOs, multisigs, and similar on-chain constructs that benefit from automated operations.

## Workflow

1. **Instantiation**: Create a new Intent with specific configuration and objects to access. Optionally store the intent in a proposal for approval. Then deposit the requested objects into the automation.

2. **Execution**: When a the automation can be executed and before expiration, start it, potentially retrieved from a stored proposal. The automation takes control of the deposited objects. Objects marked as required must be returned to the initial owner. Finally, conclude the automation's operation.
